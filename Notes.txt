In order to enable the app to host Rest endpoints, you have to either:

or 
b) Open up the proper Rest endpoints on the Windows box in question, with this command:
netsh http add urlacl url=http://*:11369/mac/ user=mduvall

You can later delete this permission if needed with:
netsh http delete urlacl http://+:11369/mac/
