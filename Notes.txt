Test driver
************
Test driver program located here:  https://github.com/mike-duvall/mike-and-conquer-test

Pass command line argument `TESTMODE` to enable driving the program from the test driver

In order to enable the app to host Rest endpoints, you have to either:
a)  Run Visual Studio(or mike-and-conquer.exe) as Administratoe
or 
b) Open up the proper Rest endpoints on the Windows box in question, with this command:
netsh http add urlacl url=http://*:11369/mac/ user=mduvall
(where user is the appropriate user)
You can later delete this permission if needed with:
netsh http delete urlacl http://+:11369/mac/

and you can list all existing permissions with:

netsh http show urlacl
