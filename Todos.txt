Next steps
***********
X  * Fix detecting when to mark unit as selected(need to move the detection box up a bit)
X  * Pull back, look at overall design, do some refactoring
X  * Fix bug where clicking enemy always initiates attack, even in player minigunner is not selected
  * Animate minigunner when moving
	X * Write failing test for XORLCW format for second minigunner image
	X * Update file parsing to handle all frames and to handle XORDelta compression
	X * Update GameSprite to handle a sequence of frames
	  X * Animate sequence of two frames
    X * Animate sequence of any number of frames
	X * Determine what frames to use in walking animation
	X	* Properly handle idle state
    X	            * Refactor and cleanup code, naming
	X * Properly handle sprites with no animation(unit selection cursor)
	X * Make MoveToEnemyAndAttack show proper movement animation


--->  * Animate minigunner when shooting
		* Determine frames
			X * Run XCC Mixer in Windows XP, see if can export frames
		 	X	* Install Windows XP on Virtual Box
---> 			* Build SpriteExperimenter class
	X * Support multiple animation sequences
  * Consider if clicking an enemy unit that is out of range is:
	* One command (MoveToEnemeyAndAttack)
	vs
	* Two commands
		1.  MoveToEnemy
		2.  Attack
  * Consider if MoveToEnemy is a separate thing from MoveToLocation
	* MoveToLocation, the location never changes, but an enemy location could change
  * Have computer randomly move NOD minigunner and attack
  * Add barracks for both sides
  * Make barracks able to generate minigunners
  * Make computer controller continually spit out minigunners and have them attack

Refactoring
***********
	* GameSprite should have work with a single texture with all it's sprite images on it
	* GameSprite should not know about ShpFile.  The interface when instantiating GameSprite should
	  just be the sprite sheet image from above
	* Create class that is responsible for parsing Shpfile into a single sprite sheet
