	* Features
		* Make game end after killing NOD minigunner
			* Make game end after GDI minigunner is killed
		* Have computer randomly move NOD minigunner and attack
		* Add barracks for both sides
		* Make barracks able to generate minigunners
			* Add toolbar with minigunner on it
			* Build minigunner when clicked
		* Make computer controller continually spit out minigunners and have them attack

	* Refactoring

		* Group files in subclasses or packages or namespaces
			* Research current C++ standards for this
		* Revisit what claases snould handle mapping ShpFile to textures
		* Make Minigunner class not create new ShpFile instances every time.  Initialize ShpFile instances up front,
		  use same one over and over

		* Grouping ShpFile images into animation sequences
		* Other thoughts
			* GameSprite should have work with a single texture with all it's sprite images on it
			* GameSprite should not know about ShpFile.  The interface when instantiating GameSprite should
			just be the sprite sheet image from above
			* Create class that is responsible for parsing Shpfile into a single sprite sheet

		* See if animation sequences are coded in INI files in original C&C

	* Misc
		 * Consider if clicking an enemy unit that is out of range is:
			* One command (MoveToEnemeyAndAttack)
			vs
			* Two commands
				1.  MoveToEnemy
				2.  Attack
		* Consider if MoveToEnemy is a separate thing from MoveToLocation
		* MoveToLocation, the location never changes, but an enemy location could change
